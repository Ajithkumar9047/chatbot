This project demonstrates a basic dialog prediction system using a Decision Tree Classifier. The system is trained on a small dataset of questions and answers, and it predicts responses to user-input questions. The implementation includes data cleaning, text vectorization, and model training using a pipeline.

## Project Structure
dialogs.txt: Input file containing initial dialog data.
script.py: Main script for data processing, model training, and interaction with the user.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
